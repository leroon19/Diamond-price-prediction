# Diamond-price-prediction
Methods such as linear, multiple linear and logistic regression have been applied to predict the price of a diamond depending on various regressors. 
The models were evaluated using such metrics as R-squared, MAE, MSE and ROC-curve, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, respectively.


# Used Dataset:
* [Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds)

This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds.

cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color: diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x: length in mm (0--10.74)

y: width in mm (0--58.9)

z: depth in mm (0--31.8)
